# dvd-bounce
ripoff of the legendary bouncing dvd screensaver

left click the bouncing window to duplicate it. (no limits)
- every duplicated window will have a random color, speed and direction of movement.

right click any of the bouncing windows to close the program.

(in case it becomes too laggy to right click, failsafe: CTRL + * )
